<h1>Raskovnik</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Casts Acid Rain, placing AoE circles on all players:</b></li>
	<li><b> Sweet Scent spawns Dravanian Hornets that deal no damage and slowly move towards the boss. Kill hornets before they reach the boss:</b></li>
	<li><b> Raskovnik will mark a player and draw them in after a few moments, stunning them for 2s, then cast Devour, a circular AoE attack. Hornets in range of Devour will give the boss a stacking damage increase:</b></li>

<h1>Tioman</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Abyssic Buster is a moderate damage frontal-cone. Tanks should keep the boss facing away from the party:</b></li>
	<li><b> Casts Chaos Blast, placing both a column and circle AoE on every player:</b></li>
	<li><b> Comet will mark two players and spawn random AoE circles around the room. After several seconds, the marks will fade and comets will fall where the players were standing, dealing room-wide AoE damage based on proximity to these meteors. Players should move as far away as possible when they drop:</b></li>
	<li><b> Becomes invincible at ~45%. Players must DPS Tioman's wings one at a time to escape this phase (the last wing will heal to full once the first is destroyed.) :</b></li>
	<li><b> Marks a player with Heavensfall during this phase, spawning clusters of circular AoEs on the player. Marked players should move away from the party:</b></li>
	<li><b> Casts Dark Star during this phase, a room-wide AoE that must be healed through:</b></li>
	<li><b> Mechanics repeat after wing phase ends:</b></li>
