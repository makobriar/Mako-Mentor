	<li><b> Stuns the tank and follows up with a high damage attack. Heal as necessary.:</b></li>
	<li><b> After switching to Phase 2, he will move to the walls and repeatedly cast Magitek Slug, an easily dodged line AoE:</b></li>
	<li><b> At the end of Phase 2 will cast Magitek Spread, a large AoE that hits everywhere except a wide cone behind him.:</b></li>

<h1>Lahabrea & Igeyorhm</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> There are two bosses active during the course of the fight. The inactive boss will cast End of Days, a line AoE, while the party fights the other boss.:</b></li>
	<li><b> Both bosses will periodically cast back to back AoEs, Blizzard Sphere which freezes, and Fire Sphere which deals damage. The AoEs will overlap greatly.:</b></li>
	<li><b> When Lahabrea is active the floor will be frozen, causing party members to slip forward when attempting to walk. Lahabrea will then cast AoE's that do large damage--be very careful not to slip into AoEs in this phase.:</b></li>
</ul>

<h1>Ascian Prime</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Dodge AoEs:</b></li>
	<li><b> Boss will mark two players with a circular AoE with a safe area in the middle. All players should stack up to avoid taking damage.:</b></li>
	<li><b> Boss will become immune and summon two orbs--Blizzard and Fire--that move towards him. As before, Blizzard will freeze the party if not broken and Fire will deal damage if not broken. Kill the Blizzard orb first in the event there is not enough DPS for both orbs.:</b></li>
	<li><b> Last phase will spawn four dark portals around the room. The boss will begin casting Universal Manipulation, which deals AoE damage and places a plethora of hazardous debuffs (think Bad Breath with stuns.) Players must jump into the portals before the cast bar completes to avoid Universal Manipulation. Some AoE healing is necessary as the portals place a DoT on each party member.:</b></li>
	<li><b> At around 30%, the boss attaches orbs to all players. The orbs will follow their tethered players, and damage and apply a debuff if they hit. If a player pops another player's orb, they take the damage, but not the debuff. Therefore it is best for players to pop each other's orbs, minding that the tank and healer should move the least so they can maintain their roles. Players can run from the orbs to stall for time if they have any hazardous debuffs or are too low on HP to survive.:</b></li>
</ul>
