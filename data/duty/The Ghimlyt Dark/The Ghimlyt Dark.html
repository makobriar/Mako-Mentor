<h1>Prometheus</h1>

	<li><b> Oil Shower:</b> 270 degree Cone directly behind the boss, hitting everywhere Needle Gun doesn't.</li>

After a delay, a fiery blast will launch from the red area to the opposite wall, dealing damage. The attack lingers, continuing to deal damage for a few seconds. The second time Prometheus uses this attack, it will first cast Freezing Missile.:</b></li>

	<li><b> Commence Air Strike:</b> Used by Julia. Eight Ceruleum tanks will drop from the sky, four on the outer edge, and four inside. Occasionally, Julia will use Roundhouse to knock the tanks around, with the added effect of dealing damage to and knocking back players in melee range.

	<li><b> Crossbones:</b> Used by Julia. Carving four "X"es into the air that travel across the arena to deal damage. When used as part of Order to Bombard, each X unerringly targets a player and inflicts knockback when it hits.</li>
	<li><b> Heirsbane:</b> Used by Julia. Marks a random player with a crosshair, then deals moderate damage to the target a short time after.</li>
	<li><b> Angry Salamander:</b> Used by Annia. A Line attack in the direction of a random player.</li>
	<li><b> Stunning Sweep:</b> Used by Annia. She jumps to a random player, then begins casting. Deals damage to players in melee range.</li>
	<li><b> The Order:</b> Used by Julia. Julia moves to the center of the arena and surrounds herself with four Crossbones projectiles. Ground AoEs will appear beneath each player, while the Crossbones launch in a cross pattern.</li>
