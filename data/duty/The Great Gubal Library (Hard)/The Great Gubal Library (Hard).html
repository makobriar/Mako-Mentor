<h1>Liquid Flame</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b>On Tornados:</b> When this ability is being readied, step into a dark circle to receive a Leaden effect that will reduce the damage to zero. Failure to do this will cause two hits of heavy damage and Vulnerability Up.</li>
	<li><b>On Quakes:</b> When this ability is being readied, step into a windy circle to float above the ground, which will reduce the damage to zero. Failure to do this will cause large damage and stun.</li>
	<li><b>On Imps:</b> This ability is quickly cast, and turns all party members into Imps, also giving them Lightning Vulnerability Up II. Immediately after transformation, Strix will begin casting On Thunder III on all targets which, if it hits an Imp, does heavy damage. To negate this, step into a green circle and turn back to normal, causing the Thunder spell to do minor damage.</li>
	<li><b>On Darkness II:</b> This ability cannot be dodged, and simply does large damage.</li>
	<li><b> Tornado - Dark Circle:</b></li>
	<li><b> Quake - Windy Circle:</b></li>
	<li><b> Imp (only if you've become one) - Green Circle:</b></li>
</ul>
