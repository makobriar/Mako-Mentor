<h1>Bosses</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Amorphous Applause:</b> Large directional AOE. Stay tight to the boss so you have a chance to dodge. </li>
	<li><b> Hydroball:</b> One party member is targeted. Stack to split the damage. </li>
	<li><b> Sea Swallows All -> Concussive Oscillation:</b> When the boss sucks you in, be prepared to run out. Several AOEs will go down. Find a safe spot, but head back in to the center after so you can dodge the Amorphous Applause that follows. </li>
	<li><b> Overflow -> Hydroball:</b> Everyone is knocked to the arena edge; run back to the middle ASAP. Hydroball is coming, and you'll want to stack up.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lugat</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Bloodburst:</b> Party-wide AoE.</li>
	<li><b> Shadowflow:</b> Creates shadow areas on the ground, which fill a large portion of the room. Stay out of those shadow areas because they will stack magic damage vulnerability.</li>
	<li><b> Enter Night:</b> Marks a player, then does a draw-in and tether. Run far from the boss to break the tether. </li>
	<li><b> Shadowsplit:</b> Summons a bunch of small versions of himself, which then cover more areas during the ensuing Shadowflow..</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Governor</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Somber Melody:</b> Party-wide AoE.</li>
	<li><b> Void Water III:</b> AoE on targeted party member.</li>
	<li><b> Virgin tears:</b> Leaves Damage over time areas, and eventually a ring all around the room. These areas will fade after she casts either Morbid Advance or Morbid Retreat</li>
	<li><b> Morbid Advance and Morbid Retreat force your character to move forward, or backwards respectively. Position yourself accordingly so that you avoid Virgin Tears as much as possible. Note that "forward" and "backward" are relative to the direction you're facing; it does not mean you'll be drawn to/repelled from the boss. Pick the safest route you can based on the skill to follow.:</b></li>
