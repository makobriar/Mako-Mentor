<h1>Daidarabotchi</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Daidarabotchi is gathering aetherial energy...:</b> Daidarabotchi will raise one of its arms and slam it down on the ground. Getting hit by this will result in medium damage and one (1) debuff stack of Vulnerability Up. It is suggested to stand on its other side. </li>
	<li><b> The Land take You, Claim You!:</b> AOE that will follow the marked player. </li>
	<li><b> Swallow You, Consume You!:</b> Daidarabotchi will hit the ground with its fist and create a circular, persistent AOE (a shimmering lake) around the centre of the area. That lake will grow over time and will cover ca. 75% of the area but will disappear again after some time.</li>
	<li><b> Mountain Falls :</b>  Blue AOE with a blue water drop on top around a player. Will deal damage after a short while. </li>

<h1>Qitian Dasheng</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> The Short End:</b> Tankbuster.</li>
	<li><b> Mount Huaguo:</b> Area wide medium AOE.</li>
	<li><b> Monkey Magicks:</b> ADD phase. Kill all Servant of the Sage before the Monkey Magicks meter is fully charged.</li>
	<li><b> Second Heaven:</b> Ultimate, after Monkey Magicks meter is fully charged or all Servant of the Sage are killed. The amount of damage done depends on the level of the charge of the Monkey Magicks meter.</li>
	<li><b> Splitting Hairs:</b> Qitian Dasheng splits in two Shadow of the Sage. Both mobs must be killed to end the fight. If only one is killed, the remaining will split again. It is suggested to damage both equally and kill them in very short succession, so a to avoid another split.</li>
	<li><b> Servant of the Sage:</b> Spawn during Monkey Magicks phase. Frequently use an AOE.</li>
	<li><b> Shadow of the Sage:</b> Two lesser copies of Qitian Dasheng. Both must be killed. Both retain the abilities or the original Qitian Dasheng. Note, that those copies share the health pool of the original Qitian Dasheng. That is, the health of the copies will drop according to the damage dealt.</li>
</ul>
