<h1>Coeurl Smriti</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b>Port and Star:</b> Massive unmarked cone AoE to Arbuda's left and right sides. Inflicts considerable damage and knockback. Stand in front or behind him.</li>
	<li><b>Fore and Aft:</b>  Massive unmarked cone AoE to Arbuda's front and back sides. Inflicts considerable damage and knockback. Stand to either side of him. </li>
	<li><b>Fourfold Shear:</b> is a slice on the tank, even if you move Arbuda follows you so buff up and get healed.</li>
	<li><b>Hellseal:</b> Works identically to the Liquid Flame's 'Seal of Night and Day' from Great Gubal Library (Hard). Simply move to the corresponding glowing symbol to dodge the attack. The timing is fairly tight, but the damage tick doesn't apply the instant the cast ends, so you have a little wiggle room.</li>
	<li><b>Tapas:</b> Places invisible markers on every and chases them with AoE bursts.</li>
	<li><b>Killer Instinct:</b> Arbuda assumes a defensive stance, similiar to Ravana. 1 side will be open to attack; attacking any other side will cause him to parry the attack back at you - even spells can be deflected. Whilst this is active, he is also capable of parrying area-effect Limit Breaks.</li>

<h1>Arbuda</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b>Spirit Wave:</b> Drop a whirlwind with an AoE Windzone on one random player, typically Ranged DPS or the Healer. Just move out of it. Doesn't last very long.</li>
	<li><b>Hurricane Kick:</b> A short-ranged 270° roundhouse kick AoE, front-facing, leaving a 90° safe-spot for melee. Inflicts Stun for a short time if it hits you.</li>
	<li><b>Touch of Slaughter:</b> Marks one player at random and knocks them down to 1 HP, typically either the Tank or one of the DPS. Rarely directly fatal by itself, but healers should heal the victim up immediately.</li>
	<li><b>Rhalgr's Piece:</b>  places a mine that causes AoE damage if triggered, best move away to the outer edge of the platform.</li>
	<li><b>Rose of Destruction:</b> Will mark one player with a large orange crosshair marker, requiring the party to stack to split damage.</li>
	<li><b>Furious Fist:</b> Ivon begins powering up for a super attack, filling the room with glowing chakra orbs that are tethered to him. Collecting the orbs reduces the strength of this attack and will grant you a short-lived stacking Damage Up buff. Once the cast completes, Ivon will float over the center of the arena and punch down around 4-5 times, followed by a finishing Impact strike that does significantly more damage. If all orbs are collected, the first barrage will be around 1,500 damage for each hit, and the final hit will be around 12,000 damage.</li>
	<li><b>Silent Roar:</b> will mark one player and casts a tidalwave towards that player. Getting hit by the wave will knock you back with a chance to fall off</li>
</ul>
