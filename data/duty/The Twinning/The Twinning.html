<h1>Alpha Zaghnal</h1>
<ul>   
	<li><b> Augurium:</b> Tankbuster. Hits in a cone-shaped area directly in front of the Alpha Zaghnal. This attack targets the ground, so the Tank can dodge it by stepping out of the way.</li>
	<li><b> Beastly Roar:</b> Moderate damage to the group.</li>
	<li><b> Pounce Errant:</b> Large player-targeted circle AoEs on each player. Alpha Zaghnal will jump to each player in sequence, dealing damage to players in the area.</li>
	<li><b> Forlorn Impact:</b> Marks each player with a number one through four, then fires a line attack at each player in sequence, dealing damage to all players in the line.</li>
	<li><b> Charge Eradicated:</b> Stack marker on one player. Afterwards, a large fire puddle will spawn where the attack hit, inflicting Burns to players standing in it. Once the first attack hits, a second stack marker will appear on another player with the same effects.</li>
	<li><b> Beta Zaghnal:</b> The east and west sides of the platform each have four containment units. If one of the Alpha Zaghnal's player-targeted attacks also hits a containment unit, it will shatter and free the Beta Zaghnal held inside. Once freed, a Beta Zaghnal will aggro onto the player who freed it.</li>
